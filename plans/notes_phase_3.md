ideally, after each task there should be a new command to ilustrate / test the functionality (add this to CLAUDE file)
articles should also have medium, domain, author (non mandatory - its possible we wont be able to parse it)
lets commit the code after each task with a reasonable (short) commit message (add to CLAUDE pls)

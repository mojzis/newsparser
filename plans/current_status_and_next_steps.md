# Current Project Status and Next Steps

## Completed Work

### Phase 1: Core Infrastructure ✅
- Complete

### Phase 2: Bluesky Integration ✅
- Complete

### Phase 2.5: CLI Tools & Data Exploration ✅
- Complete

### Phase 2.6: Configurable Search Queries ✅
- Complete

### Phase 2.9: Language Detection ✅
- Complete

### Phase 2.9.1: URL Registry ✅
- URL extraction and deduplication
- Parquet-based registry storage on R2
- Tracking of evaluation status

### Phase 3: Content Processing Pipeline (90% Complete)
**Completed:**
- ✅ Article fetching with httpx
- ✅ Content extraction (HTML to Markdown)
- ✅ Anthropic API integration
- ✅ ArticleEvaluation model
- ✅ EvaluationProcessor orchestration
- ✅ Storage to R2 in Parquet format
- ✅ CLI commands (evaluate, list-evaluations)
- ✅ URL registry integration to avoid re-processing
- ✅ Content size limits (5000 words/30000 chars)

**Remaining:**
- ❌ Update notebook with article analysis capabilities
- ❌ Enhanced error handling and monitoring
- ❌ Processing metrics and statistics

## Current System Capabilities

The system can now:
1. Collect posts from Bluesky with configurable searches
2. Detect and filter by language
3. Extract and deduplicate URLs
4. Fetch and extract article content
5. Evaluate articles using Anthropic Claude 3 Haiku
6. Store evaluations in Parquet format on R2
7. Track processed URLs to avoid duplication
8. Provide CLI access to all functionality

## Recommended Next Steps

### Option 1: Complete Phase 3 Remaining Tasks
1. Update the marimo notebook to include article evaluation analysis
2. Add processing metrics (success rates, timing, etc.)
3. Enhance error reporting and monitoring

### Option 2: Move to Phase 4 - Data Storage & Management
Since we're already storing data in Parquet format, Phase 4 is essentially complete. Consider moving to Phase 5.

### Option 3: Jump to Phase 5 - Report Generation
1. Design HTML report templates with Jinja2
2. Aggregate daily data (posts + evaluations)
3. Generate statistics and insights
4. Create visualizations
5. Upload reports to R2

### Option 4: Focus on Data Quality & Testing
1. Run the system on real data for several days
2. Analyze evaluation quality
3. Tune Anthropic prompts for better MCP detection
4. Add more comprehensive tests
5. Handle edge cases discovered in production

## Recommendation

Given the MVP approach, I recommend **Option 3: Jump to Phase 5 - Report Generation**. This would:
- Provide immediate value by creating readable reports
- Allow testing the full pipeline with real outputs
- Help identify any issues with data quality or processing
- Create a foundation for the eventual Bluesky publishing (Phase 6)

The report generation phase is relatively straightforward and would complete the core functionality loop:
Collect → Process → Evaluate → Report

This aligns with MVP principles by delivering end-to-end functionality quickly, allowing for iteration based on real usage.

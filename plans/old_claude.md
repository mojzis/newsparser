## Phase Planning Requirement

Before proceeding with any new phase or significant feature implementation:
1. Create a detailed phase plan document outlining all tasks and implementation steps
2. Document the plan in the `plans/` directory with proper naming (e.g., `phase_3.md`)
3. Update the `plans/phases_overview.md` with any new phases or modifications
4. Get user approval for the plan before beginning implementation
5. Document implementation progress and decisions in the phase-specific file

### Task Implementation Guidelines

IMPORTANT: Each task within a phase should produce a testable CLI command:
- Tasks (e.g., 1.1, 1.2, 2.1) should each add a functional command
- Don't wait until phase completion to add commands
- Commands should demonstrate the specific functionality of that task
- Include the command syntax in the task plan (e.g., "Command: `nsp process-article <url>`")
- Test the command before marking the task complete
- Document example usage in commit messages
- **ALWAYS commit changes after completing a task or significant feature**

The project follows a phased implementation approach (see `plans/phases_overview.md`):

1. **Phase 1** (Completed): Core infrastructure with Pydantic models, R2 storage interface, and logging
2. **Phase 2** (Completed): Bluesky integration using atproto SDK
3. **Phase 2.5** (Completed): CLI tools and data exploration with typer and marimo
4. **Phase 2.6** (Completed): Configurable search queries with YAML configuration and Lucene syntax
5. **Phase 3**: Content processing with Anthropic API
6. **Phase 4**: Data storage in Parquet format
7. **Phase 5**: HTML report generation
8. **Phase 6**: Automated Bluesky publishing
9. **Phase 7**: GitHub Actions automation
10. **Phase 8**: Enhancements and optimization

## Project Status

Phase 2.6 completed. The project now has:
- Complete Bluesky integration with configurable search queries
- YAML-based search configuration with include/exclude terms and Lucene syntax  
- CLI tools built with Click for operational tasks with search definition support
- Interactive data exploration notebook with marimo
- Query validation and configuration management tools
- Rich console formatting and comprehensive error handling

Next phase: Content processing with Anthropic API integration as outlined in the phases overview.

can we please make the search term configurable ? I would suggest we add a yaml file with individual search definitions (there might be more of them ), that will have tags to include and tags to exclude
the bsky doc for search https://docs.bsky.app/docs/api/app-bsky-feed-search-posts mentions lucene syntax for the query string, that should allow to provide also the terms to exclude ? (apparently #mcp is used for other things, too)
also apparently there is sort, i would suggest starting with with latest
please make this phase 2.6 and document it, too

# Turning my MCP content into a blog post on Platform Engineering

Photo of the formal garden at Great Fosters taken by Adrian

With help from Cursor, I created a Model Context Protocol server for my [“virtual adrianco” author persona](https://medium.com/@adrianco/virtual-adrian-revisited-as-megpt-5db561ef77b4) containing over 600 pieces of content and references to videos and podcasts. Then I connected it to Cursor and tried to figure out how to use it. There are some crude keyword tags and summaries in the MCP server and eventually I asked Cursor/Claude to “Summarize the content related to platform engineering, including links to videos, medium posts etc.” After some additional hints on how I wanted it formatted, what follows was produced. It’s doing a decent job, and I intend to improve the keyword extraction and summaries, so it will do a better job in the future. All I had to do to the generated content was embed the URLs into the text using the Medium editor. I checked that all the URLs were correct as well.

# A Guide to Platform Engineering: Curated Resources and Insights

Over the years, I’ve shared numerous thoughts, experiences, and insights about platform engineering through various mediums — from detailed blog posts to conference talks and podcasts. This collection represents a journey through the evolution of platform engineering, from its early days to the cutting-edge practices we see today.

# Core Platform Engineering Principles

The foundation of modern platform engineering is best captured in my recent work “[Platform Engineering Teams Done Right](https://medium.com/@adrianco/2023-02-10_Platform-Engineering-Teams-Done-Right--b3b3d4a8ad23)” from February 2023. This comprehensive article explores how successful platform teams operate in today’s complex technology landscape. It delves into the delicate balance between providing robust tooling and maintaining developer autonomy, while ensuring security and compliance at scale. For a more dynamic exploration of these concepts, you can watch my accompanying talk “[Platform Engineering Done Right](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muKaB4f2qJU)”, where I bring these principles to life through practical examples and implementation strategies.

# The Evolution of Platform Engineering

The journey from traditional operations to modern platform engineering has been remarkable. In “[Ops, DevOps and PaaS \(NoOps\) at Netflix](https://perfcap.blogspot.com/2012/03/ops-devops-and-noops-at-netflix.html)” , I documented the transformation from conventional operations to cloud-native platforms. This evolution wasn’t just about technology — it represented a fundamental shift in how we think about building and operating software systems.

This transformation continued with the rise of cloud native computing. In “[Cloud Native Computing](https://medium.com/@adrianco/2017-08-09_Cloud-Native-Computing-5f0f41a982bf)”, I explored how distributed systems principles, container orchestration, and modern observability practices have become fundamental to platform engineering. The Netflix journey provided a concrete example of these principles in action, demonstrating how theory translates into practice at scale.

# Recent Trends and Future Directions

The platform engineering landscape continues to evolve rapidly. In my recent talk “[From Netflix to the Cloud: DevOps, Microservices and Sustainability](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FY3asCV9qOE%29%2C)”, I connect the dots between traditional DevOps practices and emerging concerns about sustainability in platform design. This intersection of operational excellence and environmental responsibility represents a new frontier for platform engineers.

Platform resilience has become increasingly critical as systems grow more complex. In “[Failure Modes and Continuous Resilience](https://medium.com/@adrianco/2019-11-11_Failure-Modes-and-Continuous-Resilience-6553078caad5)”, I explore how modern platforms must be designed with resilience as a core principle, not an afterthought. The article details how monitoring, observability, and careful scaling practices come together to create robust, reliable platforms.

The latest developments in platform engineering are perhaps best reflected in my recent AWS re:Invent coverage. The integration of AI/ML capabilities, the growing emphasis on sustainable infrastructure, and the evolution of performance metrics all point to an exciting future for platform engineering. These advances are reshaping how we think about platform design and implementation.

# The Path Forward

Throughout my work in platform engineering, several themes have remained constant while evolving in sophistication. Technical excellence remains fundamental — cloud-native architecture, container orchestration, and continuous deployment aren’t just buzzwords but essential capabilities. The way we organize platform teams has also evolved, with a growing emphasis on developer experience and the careful balance between standardization and flexibility.

Looking ahead, platform engineering faces new challenges and opportunities. The integration of AI/ML capabilities is transforming how platforms operate. Sustainability has become a crucial consideration in platform design. Serverless architectures are changing our assumptions about infrastructure. Yet through all these changes, the core mission remains constant: enabling development teams to deliver value efficiently and reliably.

# Conclusion

Platform engineering continues to be at the forefront of software development evolution. The resources shared here represent not just technical documentation, but a philosophy about how modern software should be built and operated. Whether you’re building a platform team from scratch or evolving an existing one, these materials offer battle-tested insights from years of experience at companies like Netflix, AWS, and beyond.

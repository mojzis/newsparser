# Awakari App

Public

May be discovered and subscribed by other users.

Note that making a public interest private doesn't disconnect existing subscribers.

Create a new private interest for this.

ID

A unique short name useful for public interests.

Can't be changed once set.

A random name is set when not specified.

Max 36 symbols, ASCII letters, digits or dash.

Keep it secret for a private interest.

Create a new interest when id is compromised.

Active

Active interest filters the input stream.

Inactive interest doesn't get new events.

Count of simultaneously active user interests is limited. To create a new active interest or activate an existing one it may be necessary to increase the current user's limit.

Expire  A local date when the interest expires and becomes inactive. An interest never expires when this date is not set.

# Scale Your AI Stack: Apollo Summer ’25 Release

AI is changing how we build—and it’s raising the bar for how APIs need to perform. Developers need an architecture that’s designed for this new reality: flexible, composable, and ready to support the dynamic, unpredictable nature of modern AI applications.

That architecture is here and it’s powered by GraphQL.

Join us for the Apollo Summer ’25 Release to see why GraphQL is the language of modern API orchestration, and how Apollo is helping leading teams bring it to life at scale.

### **What You’ll Learn**

This launch marks a major leap forward for GraphQL-based development:

**Build smarter AI, faster** —**** Bring structure to your RAG pipelines and AI agents with the API layer built for orchestration. See how Apollo makes it easy to move from prototype to production.

**Faster runtime, zero refactors** —**** Unlock major performance gains with our latest Router enhancements—no subgraph changes required.

**Grow without hitting limits** —**** New ways to scale. New ways to ship. Discover what’s coming to help your team move faster with fewer constraints.

### **Why GraphQL, Why Now?**

The next generation of applications—especially AI-native ones—demand APIs that are:

  * Composable – Stitch together services, databases, and third-party tools in real time

  * Precise – Fetch exactly the data you need, nothing more

  * Flexible – Evolve schemas without breaking downstream clients

  * Secure – Control access at the field level

GraphQL is the only language purpose-built for this level of API orchestration. And Apollo is the platform making it production-grade.

# a second act for linkedin? - matt desiena

I’ve been testing a bunch of new AI products over the past month for work and play. My favorite at the moment is the [WordPress MCP](https://mattdesiena.com/wordpress-and-mcp-usher-in-the-next-era-of-blogging/), which allows me write this post end-to-end from Claude.

It wouldn’t be possible to write anymore about how much better publishing is without repeating myself, [which I’ve already done](https://mattdesiena.com/a-second-golden-age-of-blogging/). It’s a testament to how open platforms like WordPress and protocols like MCP can transform the way we make amazing things without a gate or subscription.

Now my focus is shifting toward other utility-first uses for clients and colleagues one platform a time. So I guess we have to talk about LinkedIn.

* * *

LinkedIn is the opposite experience of every social network I’ve ever worked on. Unlike Meta or AdWords, the [ads experience](https://business.linkedin.com/marketing-solutions/ads) is _solid._ Buying ads on LinkedIn is probably the best overall client experience on any social network, anywhere. It’s easy, fast, targeted, and I hear it’s still effective.

You know what LinkedIn struggles with? The actual social network. _The reason we spend time_ _there_.

There are endless content creators and [subreddits](https://www.reddit.com/r/LinkedInLunatics/) making an easy living mocking people who are too “LinkedIn Online.” One of last year’s [biggest memes](https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/heres-what-it-taught-me-about-b2b-enterprise-sales) was at LinkedIn’s expense, a satirical LinkedIn update that hit too close to home.

It’s not hard to see why it’s getting an internet eye-roll. The feed displays 3-4 week old content while the algorithm punishes links directing users away from the platform, and generative AI features that are intrusive instead of additive aren’t making anything of value. \(Serious offer: I would buy dinner for the PM who managed the “AI generated comments feature” just so I could ask them what they’re thinking.\)

I do, however, see serious potential for LinkedIn to return to its roots. The AI efforts aside, Microsoft has serious product minds and love the people that work there. I mocked up the LinkedIn experience we deserve below.

This is my dream.

You know what you’re feeling now? A glimpse of what we’re missing. A window into how useful it can be.

  * Conference attendee notifications\!
  * Active connection opportunities\!
  * Pinned job sections that are actually usable\!
  * Content containers that are the right size\!

Well….we have a ways to go. Poor takes on AI and promotional content aren’t the way to make social better, so I haven’t spent much time there.

**Until now.** Because now I can update it without being there.

* * *

[BrowserMCP](https://github.com/BrowserMCP/mcp), a nice way to bring lots more function to [Claude desktop](https://claude.ai/download), allows me to write what I want to post in Linkedin, quickly automate a hidden browser, read and make updates, **all without me ever going to LinkedIn**.

And it _works_. Below, you see it update my LinkedIn profile to reflect my role at Brava, an agency of contractors I’ve been working on since last year.

It even troubleshoots itself if it runs into an issue

Here’s what to do.

### install browser mcp in claude desktop

Use the instructions on the [Github](https://github.com/BrowserMCP/mcp) site.

### CREATE A NEW PROJECT

Click create new project in Claude Desktop. Call it LinkedIn navigation.

### Add Some instructions

Want them? Just steal mine below and make your own edits.

Click triangle for project Instructions.

CONTENT FILTERING:

  1. When browsing LinkedIn, completely ignore and skip over all sponsored content, promoted posts, ads, or any content marked with Promoted, Sponsored, Ad, [\#Ad](https://mattdesiena.com/tag/ad/), or [\#Partner](https://mattdesiena.com/tag/partner/). Do not acknowledge or mention these posts in any way – treat them as if they don’t exist when reporting on my feed content.
  2. NEVER read LinkedIn News section content.
  3. NEVER read vertical video posts or games.
  4. IGNORE all notifications, profile view statistics, post impressions, and pages you own.

INTERACTION RULES:

  1. NEVER press post or send a message without first confirming with me by asking “go to the moon?”
  2. DO NOT continue scrolling past the first viewport in a search unless explicitly instructed. When instructed, scroll no more than 1600px.
  3. After liking or commenting on a post successfully, visit that person’s profile to boost their visitor stats.
  4. When someone is looking for a job, recommend relevant connections from my LinkedInDatabase.csv.
  5. Automatically like agency updates from previous companies I’ve worked at.
  6. Automatically like everything posted from individuals listed under [\#Family](https://mattdesiena.com/tag/family/).

### create your prompt

You can ask it to navigate to Linkedin and read the feed, make a post, like, or comment. **Make sure your browser has the extension installed and turned on.**

It just updated my profile with my most recent job information.

Here’s the status I drafted. It’s ready to post. I’ll type go to the moon.

### boom.

That’s it. You should be seeing the above status and this blog post underneath. If you post something that comes up in my feed and I comment, expect an avalanche of automated likes and profile visits from me.

Enjoy\!

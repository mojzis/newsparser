# Apollo Community Meetup - Hands-On with Apollo MCP Server

#### **About this Meetup**

Ready to go beyond theory and start building AI Agents powered by Graph APIs delivered via the Model Context Protocol? Join us for a hands-on session where we’ll dive into **Apollo MCP Server** , show you how to expose your GraphQL APIs to AI agents, and walk through live examples you can try yourself—right from Apollo Sandbox.


Whether you’re experimenting with LLMs, building agent interfaces, or just curious about how AI and GraphQL fit together, this meetup will give you practical tools and a working mental model to get started.

####
**What we’ll do together**

  * Get a quick refresher on what MCP is and how Apollo MCP Server works

  * Walk through a real use case: exposing graph operations as tools

  * Explore best practices for designing agent-ready schemas \(naming, latency, tool shape\)

  * Q&A and community examples

#### **What is the Apollo Community?**

The Apollo Community brings together strategic API thought leaders and GraphQL practitioners in a shared safe place that offers encouragement, support, confidence, guidance, career networking, and architectural and social proof points necessary to make each champion more confident and more effective in their efforts to advance federated GraphQL.

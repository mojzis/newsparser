# How the new dream team of MCP + AI is pushing productivity boundaries in finance.

Yes, indeed. Another development cycle of AI has just started. But wait, we are not talking about the next evolution in video creation.

> We are talking about one of the biggest productivity boosts seen over the last years.

What is special this time: not only AI itself has "just" become smarter or faster \(not more than usual\), but the door to interact with existing software was just opened via MCP \(besides others\) which allows AI to interact with almost every day-to-day software program you already use.

A complete game changer. So, let's start\!

##  1\) What is an MCP?

MCP stands for Model Context Protocol. You can imagine it like a standardized “plug” that lets an LLM or AI model fetch data live from different external systems. Like the USB port was for your PC.

It was released by Anthropic in November 2024 but is now going mainstream.

MCP is currently the standard for connecting LLMs to your day-to-day software. For example, when a model asks for, say, last month's sales, the MCP pulls that figure from the right source and hands it back. This source could be an accounting software, a data room, a CRM, an ERP etc.

> The development we just waited for – using dialogue-based interaction to extract data from the software we love. Like a very smart and very fast personal assistant.

##  2\) MCP + AI – A match made in heaven

LLM are brilliant and fast. No doubt about it. BUT they tend to be unreliable and hallucinating which is often hard to detect. MCP forces your AI/LLM to cite the ground truth. They have to use a specific data source which reduces the risk for hallucinations tremendously.

> Reasoning + Verified Data = Actionable Insight

##  3\) Finance Use Cases for Start-ups and Scale-ups

In my article [“I try to kill my industry”](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/tobias-b%C3%BCrger-97581338_financetransformation-aiinfinance-vectorpartners-activity-7320380992525910017-W-iQ?utm_source=share&utm_medium=member_desktop&rcm=ACoAAAfziqkBvxRo261al6f3QXfvAJOWfHvXg-Q&trk=article-ssr-frontend-pulse_little-text-block) I envisioned the following finance use cases for AI in finance:

  * Month-End Close: Live data and autonomous reconciliation replace spreadsheets and late nights in the office.
  * Invoice Processing: OCR + AI "understand" and not only read invoices which enable them to take over accounting overall.
  * Forecasting: Emerging AI models build dynamic, language-based forecasts – and learn from feedback and historic data.
  * Controlling: Pre-trained agents scan for anomalies, suggest workflow optimizations, and flag risks in real time.
  * Stakeholder Reporting: Dashboards update themselves, KPIs are generated on the fly, and reports become conversations.

With MCP, we just got one step closer to achieve these goals as it the door opener for AI to interact with the existing systems in place.

### Here is how it works

The following overview shows three typical financial processes that occur in almost every company - from DATEV accounting to cap-table-juggling during fundraising. For each use case, you can see which systems are connected, how MCP + AI changes the process and what concrete benefits this brings in day-to-day work.

##  4\) Open AI \(Chat GPT\) & MCP

You guessed it. MCP is not the only way in the market to communicate with your software and data sources. The big LLMs moving already in that direction and are directly integrating into existing software solutions.

OpenAI \(Chat GPT\) recently rolled out turnkey ChatGPT connectors \(see screenshot\) that let the model read and write data from popular SaaS apps - Google Drive, Outlook, HubSpot, Dropbox, GitHub, Teams, and many more - without any code.

Think of connectors as a ready-made library, while MCP is the open, do-it-yourself standard:

### ChatGPT Connectors

Best for: Out-of-the-box access to mainstream tools - no setup, no schema writing.

Examples: Google Calendar, Google Drive, Outlook Email, HubSpot CRM

### MCP Functions

Best for: Custom or niche finance stacks \(Ledgy or Candis\). Even Datev could take OpenAI a while \(stay strong fellow Germans\!\).

Examples: Live cap-table simulation, KPI pull from Snowflake, invoice OCR.

In practice, you can obviously mix both: use a connector to grab a contract from Google Drive, then call an MCP OCR function to classify the cost center - getting the best of convenience and custom depth.

##  5\) Risk and Mitigation

MCP and plug-and-play connectors deliver speed, but as we know

> Finance data is unforgiving

Before you automate your ledger, ask the same questions an auditor would

Who can call which function? What gets logged? Who approves the AI’s output?

### So what are the risks and how can they be avoided?

Even with MCP’s audit trails and the convenience of plug-and-play connectors, finance teams can’t rely on automation alone.

  1. Guard against data leakage: every call may touch sensitive P&L, payroll, or equity information, so routes must be IP-whitelisted, encrypted, and tied to short-lived tokens.
  2. Remember that language models still hallucinate: pair every AI-written narrative with the raw tables it was forced to cite, and insist on CFO sign-off before the numbers go to a board deck or regulator.
  3. Beware “shadow integrations”: have a central registry and treat every new MCP function like a SaaS procurement.
  4. Resist over-automation: set transaction limits and keep an employee in the loop for postings above a materiality threshold. Nothing undermines trust faster than a bot booking a €1 million journal entry with no eyes on it.

##  6\) Summary and Food for Thought for Finance Leaders

With MCP, but also emerging integrations of LLMs into the existing tech stack, a new door for finance leaders has opened with a variety of new possibilities in automation, but also with new options to interaction with finance, behind it.

> A more interactive approach based on language allowing to work with finance with much more ease, speed and efficiency.

I believe that this is one mayor step towards the one-person-finance department because it allows AI to interact with almost every existing system already in use. At first this means more speed, transparency and efficiency and with that automatically more comfort to let AI run the show. Not just comfort, but also training and preparation for what is coming next: The autonomous finance show.

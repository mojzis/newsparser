# The Humans in the Loop: Your Agent Army Awaits

_Welcome to The Humans in the Loop, your executive summary of AI news for devs. I‚Äôm Andrew, the \[human\] author, and I‚Äôd love your feedback on this newsletter. Please feel free to email me at[andrew@heavybit.com](mailto:andrew@heavybit.com) with your thoughts. Thanks\!

**Our top story: Agents‚Ä¶Not ‚ÄúIf‚Äù But ‚ÄúWhen‚Äù?**

If this week‚Äôs updates are any indication, the future of coding will involve fleets of AI-powered agents working around the clock on codebases, managed through the leading protocol for agentic interaction and orchestration: [Model Context Protocol \(MCP\)](https://www.anthropic.com/news/model-context-protocol). _\(MCP is, of course, Anthropic‚Äôs increasingly popular open standard for AI systems to connect with other applications and data sources‚Äîand is quickly becoming the gold standard for managing agents in production.\)_ Some speakers at the recent [AI Engineer World‚Äôs Fair conference](https://www.ai.engineer/) outline such a future, pointing out how agents can be [represented as MCP servers to use with any MCP client](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uFPAtKIN-FQ&list=PLcfpQ4tk2k0Vu8ZKg_5TzN87mRhRJt71Y&index=70) and how [MCP can stabilize agent performance](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RVN9HWKmkNU&list=PLcfpQ4tk2k0Vu8ZKg_5TzN87mRhRJt71Y&index=54). \(If you missed the event, you can review [the entire on-demand playlist here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J3oJqan2Gv8&list=PLcfpQ4tk2k0Vu8ZKg_5TzN87mRhRJt71Y).\) Meanwhile, numerous new tools and resources for orchestrating agents via MCP have been popping up nonstop, including [Hugging Face‚Äôs open-source MCP server](https://hf.co/mcp) and GOOG‚Äôs [new repo to help you build full-stack Gemini Agents](https://github.com/google-gemini/gemini-fullstack-langgraph-quickstart). \(Need more MCP server options? [Here‚Äôs 50 more](https://www.marktechpost.com/2025/06/08/50-model-context-protocol-mcp-servers-worth-exploring/).\) Not to be outdone, OpenAI has launched custom [GPT connectors via MCP](https://www.testingcatalog.com/openai-preparing-custom-chatgpt-connectors-via-model-context-protocol/) for enterprise apps like Google Drive and OneDrive, a move that signals that the AI leader is serious not just about MCP, but about bringing in enterprise revenue. Could agentic orchestration via MCP finally be the fabled path to ROI at the enterprise level?

**Next Up:** The bottom line in AI news for busy devs.

typer issues - try again with a new version ... (we got stuck on it for quite some time ...)

search config from file should be default, the config from code just fallback

a page to search through the data with duck db js

duck lake ?

files aside for post authors, article authors

try the sites whether they have rss ?

evaluate the most interesting posts

generate some stats about numbers of posts ...

more sources ? hacker news ? anything else ?

it has a tendency to overdo stuff - add instructions that things should be kept supersimple, we are in MVP, startup mode, things will for sure be changed soon

commit messages are too huge :)

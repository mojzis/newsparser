content search experiment - fetch a 1000 posts mentioning just mcp, store them locally into a parquet file, go through them and suggest possible other searches (tags ...)



ensure that upon stopping the execution the data isnt lost ...

403 - dont retry

shorteners - store the url after redirect

hacker news and alike: https://lobste.rs/s/wvefir/s_mcp_stands_for_security - use the actual link ...

nth: youtube - fetch data through api ?

anthropic: store costs

i hope its not saving to pandas on each step ... maybe local json for each, just to make sure ?

split "debug commands" for steps and "main commands"

typer issues - try again with a new version ... (we got stuck on it for quite some time ...)

search config from file should be default, the config from code just fallback

a page to search through the data with duck db js

duck lake ?

files aside for post authors, article authors

try the sites whether they have rss ?

evaluate the most interesting posts

generate some stats about numbers of posts ...

more sources ? hacker news ? anything else ?

commit messages are too huge :)

some sort of "temperature" of the article ?

**** THOUGHTS
- take changes to CLAUDE file in history, the claude file as such and use it to generate a prompt for starting new projects
- think about the "guiding principles" (store bits along the way, alow to start midway ... ) and try to write them down
- try a complete refactor of this once it works
- think about testing approaches
- figure out the model availability (and suitability) & 5 hour window and history compacting and code generation in planning ? :)

- code organization - how to connect the whole together ?

- VIBING MANIFESTO
 - collection of prompts
 - suggested methodology
 - collection of articles ?


*** DONE:
add instructions that things should be kept supersimple, we are in MVP, startup mode, things will for sure be changed soon

focus on the task at hand, do always a minimal implementation, no extra stuff.

for phase 5, I would like the initial product to be really simple - just a daily list of articles, with a link to the article and also to the original post on bsky, witty, slightly funny and not very long perexes generated by claude
Home page should show the whole update from the last day + links to the previous days.
Lets make it simple, a bit like google of olden days - white background, blue links ...

add to CLAUDE - use ag for quick search through the codebase

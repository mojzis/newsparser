typer issues - try again with a new version ... (we got stuck on it for quite some time ...)

a page to search through the data with duck db js

duck lake ?

files aside for post authors, article authors

try the sites whether they have rss ?

evaluate the most interesting posts

more sources ? hacker news ? anything else ?

commit messages are too huge :)

some sort of "temperature" of the article ?


*** DONE:
add instructions that things should be kept supersimple, we are in MVP, startup mode, things will for sure be changed soon

focus on the task at hand, do always a minimal implementation, no extra stuff.

for phase 5, I would like the initial product to be really simple - just a daily list of articles, with a link to the article and also to the original post on bsky, witty, slightly funny and not very long perexes generated by claude
Home page should show the whole update from the last day + links to the previous days.
Lets make it simple, a bit like google of olden days - white background, blue links ...

content search experiment - fetch a 1000 posts mentioning just mcp, store them locally into a parquet file, go through them and suggest possible other searches (tags ...)

evaluation - store language, too.

data storage, how is it gonna work with github, where to store the md files ?

types of content
- video
- newsletter
- article
- blog post
- product update
- invite (meetup)

hacker news and alike: https://lobste.rs/s/wvefir/s_mcp_stands_for_security - use the actual link ...

nth: youtube - fetch data through api ?

anthropic: store costs


improve header


## how to write marimo notebooks
- cell variables have to be unique
 - dont call dataframe variables `df` anyway
- dont keep checking whether a dataframe has content, just do your thing
  - dont wrap output in conditional code
- dont build export features
- cant do 2 calls to mo in one cell to show content - only 1

typer issues - try again with a new version ... (we got stuck on it for quite some time ...)


a page to search through the data with duck db js

duck lake ?

files aside for post authors, article authors

try the sites whether they have rss ?

evaluate the most interesting posts

generate some stats about numbers of posts ...

more sources ? hacker news ? anything else ?

commit messages are too huge :)

some sort of "temperature" of the article ?

**** THOUGHTS
- take changes to CLAUDE file in history, the claude file as such and use it to generate a prompt for starting new projects
- think about the "guiding principles" (store bits along the way, alow to start midway ... ) and try to write them down
- try a complete refactor of this once it works
- think about testing approaches
- figure out the model availability (and suitability) & 5 hour window and history compacting and code generation in planning ? :)

- code organization - how to connect the whole together ?

- VIBING MANIFESTO
 - collection of prompts
 - suggested methodology
 - collection of articles ?


*** DONE:
add instructions that things should be kept supersimple, we are in MVP, startup mode, things will for sure be changed soon

focus on the task at hand, do always a minimal implementation, no extra stuff.

for phase 5, I would like the initial product to be really simple - just a daily list of articles, with a link to the article and also to the original post on bsky, witty, slightly funny and not very long perexes generated by claude
Home page should show the whole update from the last day + links to the previous days.
Lets make it simple, a bit like google of olden days - white background, blue links ...

add to CLAUDE - use ag for quick search through the codebase
shorteners - store the url after redirect

I would like to suggest a refactoring of the whole project.
I would like the individual stages to work on their own, each storing the outputs locally, per item ( so that if the command fails midway, we still have some data to explore)
lets please review the existing code, write down stages, types of content to store in each of the stages.
maybe it could be .md with matter instead of json ?

this way, we can keep iterating on the stages and improve by experimenting.

so please, go through the existing code, describe the stages and content types and write down a plan of what needs to be done to refactor the code. (dont write code yet please)

I like simple stuff ... I would think each phase could be a class - gets data, outputs data :) - will be glad to hear your suggestions.

ensure that upon stopping the execution the data isnt lost ...

i hope its not saving to pandas on each step ... maybe local json for each, just to make sure ?
403 - dont retry

split "debug commands" for steps and "main commands"

search config from file should be default, the config from code just fallback

errors in the details part of the report

it shows domain, not BS user and the time is not the time of the post

index doesnt list other days ?
